## Description

[Istio](https://istio.io) is an open source project that implements a service mesh, allowing for a way to observe and control the traffic flow between applications in Kubernetes.  Istio is a key tool in securing Kubernetess workloads and hardening your environment.

The istio-core Charmed Operator deploys and manages the Istio control plane components in a Kubernetes cluster.  The operator is designed to be used in conjunction with the [istio-beacon](https://github.com/canonical/istio-beacon-operator) to deploy and configure Istio using Juju.
